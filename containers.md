# Containers

  Containers are nothing but holder objects that stores a collection of other objects. You must have read some fancy keywords in some of     codes like `Vector, Set , Maps` etc. They are nothing but containers , they are implemented as class templates. But why?? To provide       greater flexibility in the type of data that we can work on. You'll understand it better if you look how templates work.
